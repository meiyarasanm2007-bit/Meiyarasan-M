# Windows Installation

Open VS Code terminal.

Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv .venv

Activate it:

.venv\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

---

# Environment Configuration

Copy:

.env.example

to:

.env

Add your Gemini API key:

GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY

For the first local test, use:

IMAGE_PROVIDER=placeholder

This avoids downloading Stable Diffusion.

# Real AI Image Generation

After confirming the application works in placeholder mode,
change:

IMAGE_PROVIDER=placeholder

to:

IMAGE_PROVIDER=diffusers

The first generation may take significantly longer because
the Stable Diffusion model must be downloaded and loaded.

A GPU is strongly recommended for practical image generation.
